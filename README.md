## Chest Disease Classification from Chest CT Scan Images

A deep learning–based end-to-end framework for automated binary classification of chest diseases using chest CT scan images, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNN) for robust feature extraction and accurate medical image diagnosis.


### Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning pipeline for binary classification of chest diseases (e.g., disease vs normal) using chest CT scan images. It includes:

- Data preprocessing

- CNN-based model training

- Evaluation metrics

- Web interface/demo for prediction

- Support for experiment tracking & reproducibility

The goal is to assist in automated clinical decision support using medical imaging.
